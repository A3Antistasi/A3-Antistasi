# How to setup

There are 2 islands in the same repository so you have to rename:
- A3-Antistasi folder to **A3-Antistasi.Altis**
- missionAltis.sqm to **mission.sqm**
- Pack the .pbo of folder A3-Antistasi.Altis
There is stil an issue on description.ext and pic.jpg  by now you'll see the Altis greek voices and Altis picture on map, we're trying to fix it asap.

That's the example if you want play Altis, if you wanna play Tanoa then you've to rename with .Tanoa

# Known Issues:

- The NATO PvP Option is still WiP, but definitely playable. Among other things to improve, the NATO heli taxi (Radio 0-8) uses vanilla BIS module and lack of some functionalities Antistasi needs. If in toruble, login/logout.
- Tanoa is a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥for AI driving on roads. They have built a lot of small tracks which AI uses badly due to the dense jungle which surrounds them. Possible solutions are WiP.
- Mission balancing is still under study.
- Some features have not been heavily tested. That's why are you're here :)

Mission is on Beta STAGE.
