# Antistasi-WotP
Following successfull A3- Antistasi Altis, Warlords of the Pacific is the newest sequel of the guerrilla simulator. 

Those who enjoyed Antistasi will find the landscape in Tanoa as the most suitable for the war they like.

A Persistent Whole Map mission, for SP or MP Coop, focused on Resistance Infantry and Guerrilla Tactics. 

Features: 

- Playable in SP, MP, and persistent open server MP.
- Blufor vs Greenfor vs Redfor with dynamic battles, let Blufor and Redfor fight and strike them while they're busy, don't drag too much attention or the aggressivity against SDK will increase causing heavy reactions. Be nice with their wounded instead, if healed they might think to join you!
- AI Enemy Commander which reacts to your movements and manages his resources.
- Around 18 possible Sidemissions: Assasination, Logistics, Destroy Assets, Rescue POWS, Conquer Missions in a wide variety on each type.
- Possibility of Undercovered Operations, same as a Resistance soldier can do.
- Persistent Stat Save System: You won't loose game or server progress upon a game update. 
- Enhaced AI Squadmate control.
- AI friendlies and enemy can drag/carry and heal injured soldiers, not working with ACE3 mod.
- AI Garrison that use static weapon you add 
- Forests get destroyed as long as the war evolves. 
- Up to 3 Headless Client supported. 
- Integrated Mods: TFAR, ACRE, RHS, FFAA. None of them mandatory. 

# Known Issues:

- The NATO PvP Option is still WiP, but definetly playable. Among other things to improve, the NATO heli taxi (Radio 0-8) uses vanilla BIS module and lack of some functionalities Antistasi needs. If in toruble, login/logout.
- Tanoa is a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥for AI driving on roads. They have built a lot of small tracks which AI uses badly due to the dense jungle which surrounds them. Possible solutions are WiP.
- Mission balancing is still under study.
- Some features have not been heavyly tested. That's why are you here :)

Mission is on ALPHA STAGE. It is very unlikely but some showstopper may appear.
