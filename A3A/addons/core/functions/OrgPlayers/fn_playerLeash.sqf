Maintainer: Caleb Serafin
    If the current player is not a member, it will loop every 60 seconds to check the distance from the player to HQ or any member.
    However, if there are no members online, it will allow the player unlimited distance from HQ.
    If there is a member online, it will warn the player and begin a 61 second countdown
    See playerLeashRefresh for teleportation compatibility.

Return Value:
    <ANY> Undefined

Scope: Clients, Global Effect
Environment: Scheduled
Public: No (Only spawned once in initClient)
Dependencies:
    <SCALAR> memberDistance
    <ARRAY> A3A_FFPun_Jailed
    <ARRAY> markersX

Example:
    [] spawn A3A_fnc_playerLeash;

    // Following snippet is used to debug as non-member after the game has initialised:
    memberDistance = 1000;
    membershipEnabled = true;
    membersX deleteAt (membersX find getPlayerUID player);
    A3A_DEV_playerLeash_debug = true;
    [] spawn A3A_fnc_playerLeash;
