"Hidden" missions, spawn based on proximity requiring immediate action.
    e.g. 
    Driving through a town and refugees need evac immediately.
    Flagged down by civilian with intel on a traitor currently escaping in vehicle.
    Run into a convoy with logistics or intel.

Real logistics
    Convoys or airlift are used to move manpower/materiel. Could be virtual until within enemy proximity.

Real intel
    Missions to gain intel: capture high rank units, e.g. convoy or assassination like but you capture instead of kill.
    Ambient intel from civilians - build networks in towns based on civilian support to get reports on enemy movements in the area.
    Help from outside agents - meet shady character in secluded area, chance you need to defend them against a special forces strike team?
