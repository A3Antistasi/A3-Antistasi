Study the surrounding markers and roads between them well. If you start near a road between enemy zones, a patrol may appear and kill Petros"]];

First you have to gather enough resources (HR and Money) in order to be able to conquer and hold your positions. This mission tries to simulate real life guerilla situations. If in doubt, ask yourself what would you do in real life. Don't expect to win every time. Hit and Run is the basic manoeuvre here. Earn every resource, weapon and ammunition to gather enough assets in order to be a real challenge for the enemy. In the meantime, disturb its operations and gain support from the population."]];

The citizens of each town support the enemy or Faction to some amount. The dominant faction is the one who owns the city and benefits from their support in terms of money and human resources (HR). Your actions may lower enemy Support or raise yours, or both. Killing enemies, accomplishing missions, conquering resources, and power-stations, affect the amount of citizen support."]];
player createDiaryRecord ["Features",["Arsenal","Scavenge for items, weapons and magazines and put them in your HQ Ammobox. Once you have a specific amount of an them, they will be unlocked and added to the Arsenal for personal use (and for your Faction squads). The amount required to unlock depends on how many assets the Faction has unlocked and the number of factories owned. Unlocked weapons, optics and night-vision Googles may also change AI load-out. Basic militiamen are especially affected by this: their load-out will start from small SMGs and progress to having an extra AA / AT launcher. Please note this will not affect their dress, which will depend on the current Faction Skill Level (helmets and uniform). Arsenal is the standard BIS Arsenal, check their documentation for interaction and use.<br/>To see the amounts required to unlock each group of items, open the HQ Ammobox and you will receive a detailed report on the right."]];

If you are discovered you won't be able to go undercover on foot again for 30 minutes. You can also go undercover by getting into any civilian vehicle. You will lose undercover status by firing any weapon or being spotted far from a road. If you are discovered you won't be able to go undercover in that vehicle again. Getting close to enemy Airbases, outposts and roadblocks will also make you lose undercover status."]];

Your AI squad-mates won't have a radio until you unlock it from the Arsenal. Without a radio, if an AI squad-mate gets too far away, they will get lost and return to the leader's position after completing the last order they received. To avoid this, you may scavenge some radios from enemy (AutoRearm feature will do) or let the AI use a military vehicle which has long range radios.
