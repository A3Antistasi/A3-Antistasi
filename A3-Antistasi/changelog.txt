Version 2.3 - 26th July 2020

Changes from version 2.2.1 to 2.3 Antistasi Community Edition

=============  Most significant changes with description  ======================

Overhauled airstrikes to keep the sanity:
- Halved the number of bombs in any given airstrike, Made the bombs used more sensible. (MK82 for HE, CBU for cluster, Glide bomb for napalm.

New Salvage Mission implemented:
- In this new mission a ship bound for the rebellion with supplies have been discovered and sunk just off the coast, these supplies are now at the bottom of the sea and about to be recovered by the hostile forces that sunk it in the first place. But all hope is not yet lost, we have a shot window of opportunity to recover theses supplies, by diving down and winching the supplies from the bottom of the sea right underneath their noses. Time is of the essence so hurry and locate a suitable boat with a winch like the motorboat and get our supplies back.

Introduced new Aggro and Warlevel system
- Aggression is now displayed better, synched correctly and actual playable. Say goodbye to steady 100 aggression.

Adapted QRFs and attacks
- Adapted vehicle selection for QRFs. The heavier the unit, the later it will arrive in the game.
- Adapted vehicle amount for QRFs and attacks. These are now heavily dependant on the aggression of the attacking faction. Doesn't mean you wont get overrun sometimes.

Introduced a new Intel system
- Search enemies and locations for valuable intel on the enemy faction. But be aware that there is nothing without a risk.

Temporary blackscreen for singleplayer
- As we in the future will seize SP compatibility we have implemented a blackscreen which pops up when joining a SP campaign so players are informed regarding that. The blackscreen only lasts a few seconds and currently people are still able to continue and finish their campaigns.
- Please note that we advice to play locally hosted MP even if you only want to play on your own. This is more stable, has less bugs and gives you the possibility to adapt parameters to your liking.

Implemented Jeroen Nots Enhanced Debug Console
- We added an enhanced debug console in which you can save debug commands. To set a name for a saved command, add a comment in the first line. Example: //ThisIsaTitle

Version 2.2 - 04th January 2020

Changes from version 2.1.2 to 2.2 Antistasi Community Edition

=============  Major  ======================

  GAMEPLAY CHANGES
  - Changed vehicle spawn mechanic. Vehicles now spawn in suitable positions and without the unwanted explosion.
  - Added random convoys driving around and attacking roadblocks on their way. These will grow stronger over time and follow a specific system, but we wont reveal this yet.
  - Random convoys attack roadblocks on their ways.
  - Added the ability to breach open vehicles with explosives. Get an engineer and break these pesky vehicles open. You maybe want to keep a medic close, damaged vehicles tend to explode.
  - Changed the way resource points and factories become destroyed. You see something unusual, shoot it, a industrial building is blocking your way, mortar it, strange civis running around, sho.. You get the point. And watch the barrels.
  - Complete overhaul of starting weapons and equipment for all variations of rebel side. Guerilla fighters don't start with high-end weaponary, they start with sandals.
  - Rebel AI now appropriately gear from unlocked equipment. Can't win a rebellion with fishing vests, you know.
  - Overhaul of the loot tables. A much wider variety of gear should spawn.
  - Complete re-balance of AI Skill. Cut the brains of the enemies in half and implanted the other half into your AI units. They should be a lot less useless while fighting worse enemies.
  - Adapted Antistasi to the new Ace version 3.13.0.

  PARAMETER CHANGES
  - Created parameters to allow DLC gear. Currently, this affects items in crates and civilian vehicles. We heard your call for it. Just make sure you use it with caution.
  - Created parameters to customise the variety and amount of loot that gets spawned in crates.
  - Created parameters to allow unlocked guided launchers and explosives. So please stop asking for cheats in the help channel.
  - Created a parameter to stop an unlocked weapon from unlocking its first valid magazine. For the ones, who really love looting.
  - Created a parameter to disable members having access to the Faction Garage, allowing only the commander access.
  - Created a (experimental) parameter that disables all of the balance checks on loot crates. Want 100% random loot crates? Toggle this. (Not advised, but feel free to for science.)
  - Added an option to disable civilian traffic. The group state they are driving in is careless, and it is a fitting descripting of their driving skills. You can now turn off random death by driving civilians.

  MAP CHANGES (OLDER MAPS WILL NO LONGER WORK WITH 2.2 OR ABOVE)
  - Added Kunduz as a playable map.
  - Added Tembelan as a playable map.
  - Added Chernarus_winter including a snow script as a playable map.
  - Added Anizay as a playable map.
  - Reworked map marker for Altis, Tanoa, Malden, Chernarus_summer and Livonia.

==============  Minor  ========================

  - Undercover medics can now heal civilians/undercover players without becoming overt. You never know, when you need it. Also check the known errors.
  - Made punishment missions a bit less punishing. They are won easier now. Did someone said casuals?
  - Updated stringtable. French is now partly available.
  - All items now get removed when player respawn. No more stolen radios from the afterlive.
  - Readd maps when player respawn. Yeah, that wasn't considered enough.
  - Regular players are now allowed to place the HQ if Petros died and there is no boss.
  - Moved vehicle-specific actions to VehicleBox. You know, the repair box. Vehicles can now access the arsenal from there too!
  - Increased spawn distance on HC vehicles. You may have to search a bit, but the spawning should be better now.
  - Every airfield has at least one manned AA vehicle in every case.
  - Members now have access to the faction garage by default.
  - Complete overhaul of starting weapons and equipment for all variations of rebel side.

  - Swapped panzerfaust to RPG-75 for Greenfor RHS rebels.
  - Added an option to disable civilian traffic.
  - Balance pass for "CSAT Punishment" mission.

================  Groundwork  ===================

  - Reworked the garrison system to build a new reinforcement system on top of it. Believe us, you will know once we got this running.
  - Added a system to simulate convoys of all types. Convoys 12 kilometer away will no longer kill your server performance. Even if there are many.
  - Created a template naming convention and precursory files. New names for better understanding. But also alot more files.
  - Added Nav Grids. They are large and we are sorry about this. But they have a really important job.
  - Added localisation support for Map briefing screen.
  - Set the NATOCrates to use a weighted distribution method, rather than random.
  - Created a new Parameter for truly random Crates, if wanted. Look for the [Experimental] option in parameter selection.

================ Bugfixes ========================

  - Dialog back buttons now work correctly. No struggling with dialogs anymore.
  - ACRE radios are now recognized correctly.

  - Fixed access to HC squad level commands on map interface.
  - Certain weapons no longer include base attachments with them. No more free bipods.
  - Fixed many bad case and improper item defines throughout the mission.
  - Fixed money loss on death to only penalize once. It was 10% + 5%, now it is 15%. Why was it like this? We don't know either.
  - There should be much less inconsistency in save data. You know, first this, then that, just like your Ex. We broke up, too.
  - Fixed needed time displayed wrong in supply mission description.
  - Fixed truck reference in supply mission description.
  - Fixed RHS side detection.
  - Readded dedicated server startup delay. We figured out it was actually needed. Humans make mistakes you know.
  - Fixed money-by-dismissal exploit. No more human trafficing. That was bad from the start.
  - Fixed ACRE2 radios not being recognized as such.
  - Fixed TFAR radios not being unlocked on start.
  - Fixed GPS not in starting items.
  - Fixed medical kits claiming to be unknown in arsenal. We all know you're there, don't act up.
  - Fixed arsenal being called before it could init.

  - Items system now scans config for defines instead of relying on manual input.
  - Extensive sorting and commenting on format for template files, and initVar.
  - Moved all units of the same side to the same template (police and militia).
  - Added logging to various server functions.
  - Stopped modifying items in 'onPlayerRespawn'.
  - Stopped player reading a significant portion of initVar on connecting to a server.
  - Began work on removing faction or side names from variable names throughout mission.
  - Changed destroyedCities to destroyedSites.
  - Significant refactoring and organizing of various scripts throughout the mission. They all kept their names, but you may have to search for them.
  - Moved map templates. They don't have to be in the unit templates folder. We don't want them there.
  - Reworked marker detection. It's even faster now.
  - Added a log function for arrays.
  - Unified all template files. Makes changing it alot easier for all of us.
  - Added a PR templates. We should have done this a long time ago.

  - (Destroy Heli Mission) If you manage to steal the truck while it is trying to transport the heli back, the mission will fail (The fix for this is WIP)
  - The updated ACE version 3.13.0 maybe has introduced new issues with ACRE. We are investigating and thankful for input.
