The usage of this script is fairly easy, with only a few rules to follow.

There are three reason you are looking at this file. The instructions depends on
why you are here. These three reasons are:

- You are Spoffy and have to review this nightmare of a PR. I am sorry, I really
  am. I am gonna review the next nightmare PR of yours, I promise.

- You want to port Antistasi to another map. Great, we are always glad to see
  people, who want to help us. Even if your doing it for yourself, then we are
  glad, you are having enough fun with this mission to get yourself to port it.
  We can't force you, but if you think the port you are doing haven't been done
  before, we would like to have it (you will get the credits of course).
  Send us a message on the official website or Discord, we will not waste your time.
  You can just skip the next segment and jump direct to the instructions.

- You want to do a pathfinding system for your own mission.Thats great but may
  not be the think you really need. Nearly every moving object in Arma has a own
  pathfinding algorithm and does not need help from the outside. Are you sure
  you need a real pathfinding algorithm? If so, you can go to the instructions
  and follow them. But for the pathfinding to work, you will have to send me a
  message to get all the needed files. You could try to collect them out of the
  files of the Antistasi code, but I guess, I would be the easier solution.
  Getting in contact with me through the Official Antistasi Discord is the way
  to go there.

============================= Instructions =====================================

  DO THIS ON AN EMPTY MAP, HAVING ANTISTASI OR OTHER SCRIPTS RUNNING IN THE
  BACKGROUND WILL DRASTICALLY INCREASE RUNTIME !!!
  This is no script to let run on the startup of a mission, an empty Altis
  takes around five minutes to complete.

  Preparing the map:

    The script has to know where to start, so it needs a few markers.
    Each map needs AT LEAST ONE marker. For maps with multiple island,
    which are not connected with roads, it need a marker for every
    island, which is not connected to an island with a marker. If you are
    unsure, which island are connected or not, just set up marker for every
    island.

    The marker has to be positioned on road junctions. It does not has to
    be exactly on the junction. Putting the marker somewhere near it will
    work to. I would recommand using empty markers.

    Last thing about the markers. Every marker has to be named with
    'roadMarker' in it. As long as 'roadMarker' is in it the script will
    detect it. 1_roadMarker is fine, roadMarker_1 is fine too, you get
    the concept.

    The map is prepared. Lets get the script running.

  Running the script:

    Start the preprared map in editor SP. Hit Esc to get the console open.
    Put in the line
    [] execVM "NavGridTools\createNavGrid.sqf"
    and hit Local Execution. There will be a hint saying the setup started,
    if not you will get an error. Double check the line in that case.

    A large hint will pop up. Read it! If you have not already open the
    file as stated in the hint. Double check the file name (its important
    for the load of the grid) and keep the text editor open. Once you done
    that, click on continue.

    If there is an error with the markers, the script will tell you. Two
    errors are possible. First is, you didn't place any marker or named
    them wrong. Second, one or more marker are not placed on junctions.
    The marker names are displayed, double check the marker. If you are
    sure, that the marker is on a junction, but the script denies it,
    choose a different junction. Some junctions can't be detected as such
    in the start of the script.

    If any error occurs, the script will abort once you hit continue on
    the hint.

    If no error occurs the game will switch to map view and you can have
    a look how the algorithm is working. Oddly relaxing if you ask me.

  Saving the data:

    The script will tell you, once it has finished. All the collected
    data is now saved in your clipboard. Switch over to the file we
    opened earlier and hit Ctrl + V to paste the content. The content
    already is correct sqf code. There is no need to add anything.
    Save the file as "NavGrids/navGrid<worldName>.sqf" as the hint told
    you. Antistasi can now load this file whenever needed.

  Checking the map:

    Last thing you should do is check the maps. If you missed any island
    or something, you can see it now.

=========================== Known Problems =====================================

  There is no data regarding the type of road. If there is please tell me
  and I will add this feature. So long all roads are equal.

  Small paths through forest (mostly on Tanoa) are not recognized as roads.
  These are rebels only paths :D
