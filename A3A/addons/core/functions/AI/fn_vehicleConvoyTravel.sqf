/*
    A3A_fnc_vehicleConvoyTravel
    Make vehicle move down route, ignoring enemies and following other convoy vehicles

Parameters:
    <OBJECT> Vehicle.
    <ARRAY> Array of AGL(?) positions from start to end position.
    <ARRAY> Array of vehicles in convoy, first is lead vehicle. Note: Shared between scripts.
    <NUMBER> Maximum convoy (lead) speed in km/h.
    <BOOLEAN> True if vehicle is critical (shouldn't give up even if timed out)
