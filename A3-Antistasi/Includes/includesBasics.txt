How to include finles:

to include files use the preprocessor command "#include {filepath}"
Example: #include "Includes\common.inc"
FIX_LINE_NUMBERS()

includes are folder relative, meening it paths from where the file using it is located.
therefore if you want to include a file located in a higher folder u need to go up the folder tree.
you can do this by usin "..\"

Example: #include "..\Includes\common.inc"
FIX_LINE_NUMBERS()
 will move up to the folder above, then in to the folder called "includes" then grabing the contents of the file "LogMacros.inc"
 and putting it into the file in place of the preproccesor command.

For general use in Functions/{Folder}/{File}
using: #include "..\..\Includes\common.inc"
FIX_LINE_NUMBERS()
would include the new logging macros for antistasi
