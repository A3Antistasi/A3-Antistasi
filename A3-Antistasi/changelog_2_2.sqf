CHANGELOG 2.2

=============  Major  ======================

  GAMEPLAY CHANGES
  - Changed vehicle spawn mechanic. Vehicles now spawn in suitable positions and without the unwanted explosion
  - Added random convoys driving around and attacking roadblocks on their way. These will grow stronger over time and follow a specific system, but we wont reveal this yet.
  - Added the ability to breach open vehicles with explosives. Get an engineer and break these pesky vehicles open. You maybe want to keep a medic close, damaged vehicles tend to explode
  - Changed the way resource points and factories become destroyed. You see something unusual, shoot it, a industrial building is blocking your way, mortar it, strange civis running around, sho.. You get the point. And watch the barrels.
  - Complete overhaul of starting weapons and equipment for all variations of rebel side. Guerilla fighters don't start with high-end weaponary, they start with sandals.
  - Rebel AI now appropriately gear from unlocked equipment. Can't win a rebellion with fishing vests, you know.
  - Complete re-balance of AI Skill. Cut the brains of the enemies in half and implanted the other half into your AI units. They should be a lot less useless while fighting worse enemies.

  PARAMETER CHANGES
  - Created parameters to allow DLC gear. We heard your call for it. Just make sure you use it with caution.
  - Created parameters to modify or prohibit crate loot. You don't want to get a specific item, you don't get it (PBP What exactly is meant by this)
  - Created parameters to allow unlocked guided launchers and explosives. So please stop asking for cheats in the help channel.
  - Created a parameter to stop an unlocked weapon from unlocking its first valid magazine. For the ones, who really love looting.
  - Added an option to disable civilian traffic. The group state they are driving in is careless, and it is a fitting descripting of their driving skills. You can now turn off random death by driving civilians.

  MAP CHANGES
  - Added Kunduz as a playable map
  - Added Tembelan as a playable map
  - Reworked map marker for Altis, Tanoa, Malden and Livonia. Old maps will no longer work with 2.2 or above.

==============  Minor  ========================

  - Undercover medics can now heal civilians/undercover players without becoming overt. You never know, when you need it. Also check the known errors.
  - Made punishment missions a bit less punishing. They are won easier now. Did someone said casuals?
  - Updated stringtable. French is now partly available.
  - All items now get removed when player respawn. No more stolen radios from the afterlive.
  - Readd maps when player respawn. Yeah, that wasn't considered enough.
  - Regular players are now allowed to place the HQ if Petros died and there is no boss.
  - Moved vehicle-specific actions to VehicleBox. You know, the repair box.
  - Increased spawn distance on HC vehicles. You may have to search a bit, but the spawning should be better now.


 ================  Groundwork  ===================

  - Reworked the garrison system to build a new reinforcement system on top of it. Believe us, you will know once we got this running.
  - Added a system to simulate convoys of all types. Convoys 12 kilometer away will no longer kill your server performance. Even if there are many.
  - Created a template naming convention and precursory files. New names for better understanding. But also alot more files.
  - Added Nav Grids. They are large and we are sorry about this. But they have a really important job.

================ Bugfixes ========================

  - Dialog back buttons now work correctly. No struggling with dialogs anymore.
  - ACRE radios are now recognized correctly
  - Fixed an error relating to toolkits being added to the arsenal incorrectly
  - Fixed one of the civilian traffic options not working. 0.5 (Low) was never working. Did anyone catch that?
  - Fixed broken easy difficulty setting.
  - Fixed "Destroy the Helicopter" mission
  - Fixed access to HC squad level commands on map interface
  - Certain weapons no longer include base attachments with them. No more free bipods.
  - Fixed many bad case and improper item defines throughout the mission
  - Fixed money loss on death to only penalize once. It was 10% + 5%, now it is 15%. Why was it like this? We don't know either.
  - There should be much less inconsistency in save data. You know, first this, then that, just like your Ex. We broke up, too.
  - Fixed needed time displayed wrong in supply mission description
  - Fixed truck reference in supply mission description
  - Fixed RHS side detection
  - Readded dedicated server startup delay. We figured out it was actually needed. Humans make mistake you know.
  - Fixed money-by-dismissal exploit. No more human trafficing. That was bad from the start.
  - Fixed ACRE2 radios not being recognized as such
  - Fixed TFAR radios not being unlocked on start
  - Fixed GPS not in starting items
  - Fixed medical kits claiming to be unknown in arsenal. We all know you're there, don't act up.
  - Fixed arsenal being called before it could init
  - Fixed Petros not respawning. Well, at least in theory.
  - Fixed statics at base sneaking away. We got you, sneaky bastards.

=================  Code  =========================

  - Arsenal can now be setup in multiple objects
  - Rebuilt items detection system completely
  - Items system now scans config for defines instead of relying on manual input
  - Extensive sorting and commenting on format for template files, and initVar
  - Moved all units of the same side to the same template (police and militia)
  - Added logging to various server functions
  - Stopped modifying items in 'onPlayerRespawn'
  - Stopped player reading a significant portion of initVar on connecting to a server
  - Began work on removing faction or side names from variable names throughout mission
  - Changed destroyedCities to destroyedSites
  - Significant refactoring and organizing of various scripts throughout the mission. They all kept their names, but you may have to search for them.
  - Moved map templates. They don't have to be in the unit templates folder. We don't want them there.
  - Reworked marker detection. It's even faster now.
  - Added a log function for arrays.
  - Unified all template files. Makes changing it alot easier for all of us.
  - Added a PR templates. We should have done this a long time before
  - PlayerMarker are now getting loaded by server
  - Replaced BIS_fnc_selectRandom with selectRandom
  - Replaced type checks with isEqualType
  - Renamed AAFKilledEH to invaderOccupantUnitKilledEH
  - Changed the way dlc items get detected


=================  Known issues  ==========================

  - Undercover medics cannot heal without breaking cover while looking at an overt unit (A fix for this is WIP)
  - (Destroy Heli Mission) If you manage to steal the truck while it is trying to transport the heli back, the mission will fail (A fix for this is WIP)
