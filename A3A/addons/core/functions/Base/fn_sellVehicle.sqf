Attempts to sell the vehicle the player is looking at.
Vehicle cannot be sold if owned by another player.

Arguments:
    <OBJECT> Player who is trying to sell a vehicle.
    <OBJECT> cursorObject of the player.

Return Value:
<NIL> nil

Scope: Server/HC, All calls need to be executed on one machine, using an HC is also possible.
Environment: Unscheduled, is used to sell vehicles, execution cannot be stacked and exploited.
Public: No
Dependencies:
<STRING> ownerX found on vehicles, contains UID of player who bought it.
<ARRAY> Template vehicle arrays, see costs = call {}.

Example:
// From a button control:
action = "if (player == theBoss) then {closeDialog 0; nul = [player,cursorObject] remoteExecCall [""A3A_fnc_sellVehicle"",2]} else {[""Sell Vehicle"", ""Only the Commander can sell vehicles.""] call A3A_fnc_customHint;};";

// Testing spam:
for "_i" from 1 to 1000 do {
    [player,cursorObject] remoteExecCall ["A3A_fnc_sellVehicle",2];
};
