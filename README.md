# Antistasi-WotP
Following successfull A3- Antistasi Altis, Warlords of the Pacific is the newest sequel of the guerrilla simulator. 

Those who enjoyed Antistasi will find the landscape in Tanoa as the most suitable for the war they like.

A Persistent Whole Map mission, for SP or MP Coop, focused on Resistance Infantry and Guerrilla Tactics. 

Features: 

- Foreign Politics / Civil Support System
- Tanoa is in an All vs All war with the following factions fighting eachother: BLUFOR (NATO Pacific, Gendarmes, FIA as PMC), OPFOR (CSAT Pacific) and Syndikat.
- MP PvP Element: Players may join a NATO SpecOp counterinsurgency squad and try to disturb Syndikat operations (WiP).
- Around 18 possible Sidemissions which may happen everywhere. Assasination, Logistics, Destroy Assets, Rescue POWS, Conquer Missions in a wide variety on each type.
- Possibility of Undercovered Operations, same as a Resistance soldier can do. 
- AI Enemy Commander which reacts to your movements and manages his resources. 
- Persistent Stat Save System: You won't loose game or server progress upon a game update. 
- Enhaced AI Squadmate control. 
- Playable in SP, MP, and persistent open server MP.
- Up to 3Headless Client supported. 
- Cooperate while compete to be the commander of your side (MP Only) 
- Build minefields, improve bases with static weapons which AI will use. 
- Tano and it's forests get destroyed as long as the war evolves. 
- Integrated Mods: TFAR, ACE3. None of them mandatory. 
- Wonderful jungles to fight in.

# Known Issues:

- The NATO PvP Option is still WiP, but definetly playable. Among other things to improve, the NATO heli taxi (Radio 0-8) uses vanilla BIS module and lack of some functionalities Antistasi needs. If in toruble, login/logout.
- Tanoa is a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥for AI driving on roads. They have built a lot of small tracks which AI uses badly due to the dense jungle which surrounds them. Possible solutions are WiP.
- Mission balancing is still under study.
- Some features have not been heavyly tested. That's why are you here :)

Mission is on ALPHA STAGE. It is very unlikely but some showstopper may appear.
